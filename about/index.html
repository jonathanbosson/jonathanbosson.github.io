			<h1>About</h1>

			<p>I started studying the <em>Master of Science in Media Technology and Engineering (MT)</em> 2012 and am to finish it summer 2017. I bet at this point some of you are scratching your beard at what kind of program this is. In short, it's a broad computer science program with courses stretching from computer vision to VR to machine learning. It has a great mathmatical foundation and strong collaboration with the Visualization Center here in Norrk√∂ping.<br>
			Personally I've come to love VR/AR, rendering and 3D graphics. Computer vision and developing new ways for humans to interact with technology is a big passion of mine. At the core, I'm an internationalist. I love travelling and to connect with people all over the world.</p>
