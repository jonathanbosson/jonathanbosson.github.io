			<h1>About</h1>

			<img width="190" height="190" align="right" src="/images/jonte.jpeg">
			<p>I started studying the <em>Master of Science in Media Technology and Engineering (MT)</em> 2012 and am to finish it autumn 2017. In short, MT is a broad computer science program with courses vailable from computer vision to VR to machine learning. It has a great mathematical foundation and strong collaboration with the Visualization Center in Norrk√∂ping.
			Working with VR/AR and developing new ways for humans to interact with technology is a big passion of mine. 
			<br>
			At the core, I'm an internationalist. I love travelling and to connect with people all over the world. I'm currently a research scholar at the SCI institute in Salt Lake City working on developing multi-touch interfaces for public space explorations in OpenSpace as part of my master's thesis. OpenSpace is an open source interactive data visualization software system designed to visualize the entire known universe.
