title: "Procedural Planet Creation"

This was a short one-man project in a course I went to last autumn. Procedural Methods for Images. Exciting, eh? It's quite fashinating! This project only touches the surface of what is possible with procedural rendering and it's nowhere near close to what Pixar is doing in their animated movies.

So this is a live website you can use whenever you want and create whatever planet you want. You can generate mountains and valleys as well as environment biomes.
I used a dependency framework called requirejs together with textjs to let me write glsl code and feed it to WebGL. Somewhere in there, there is something Chrome or IE doesn't like. You can try it out on firefox or Opera [here](http://jonathanbosson.github.io/procPlanets/planet/) though.

The [report](/reports/jonbo665_planetcreation.pdf) is short and informal. Check the source on [github](https://github.com/Liljan/AKRS3D).
