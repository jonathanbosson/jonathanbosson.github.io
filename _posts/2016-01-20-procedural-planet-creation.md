title: "Procedural Planet Creation"

This was a short one-man project in a course I went to last autumn. Procedural Methods for Images. Exciting, eh? It's quite cool! This project only touches the surface of what is possible with procedural rendering and it's nowhere near close to what Pixar is doing in their animated movies. I hope I get the chance to dive deeper into procedural methods sometime in the future.

So this is a live website where you can create whatever kind of planet you want. You can generate mountains and valleys as well as environment biomes.
I used a dependency framework called requirejs together with textjs to let me write glsl code and feed it to WebGL. Somewhere in there, there is something Chrome or IE doesn't like. You can try it out on firefox or Opera [here](http://jonathanbosson.github.io/procPlanets/planet/) though.

The [report](/reports/jonbo665_planetcreation.pdf) is short and informal. Check the source on [github](https://github.com/Liljan/AKRS3D).
