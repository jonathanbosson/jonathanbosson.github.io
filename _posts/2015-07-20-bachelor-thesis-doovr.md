DooVR is one of the projects I am most proud of yet and it was the thesis through which I got my BSc. 
It uses an Oculus Rift together with any type of 5 to 6 DoF (degrees of freedom) tracking system in order to model in VR.
DooVR won the C Awards 2015 in category Creative Technical Application as well as <em>Gr√• Kuben</em> for Best Technical Project in MT-kuberna 2016. However, rather than having me talk about how cool the project is I will let you have a look.

The report can be read [here](/reports/DooVR_Rapport.pdf), as of now there is no English version so I wish you luck on understanding it. The source is available on [github](https://github.com/Grahnen92/DooVR).
