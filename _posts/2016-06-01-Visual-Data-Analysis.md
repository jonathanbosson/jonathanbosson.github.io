This project was one of the examinating tasks in a Visual Data Analysis course, <em>TNM008</em>. This is our data analysis from the VAST Mini Challenge 2 2016 where the developer was given a set of different datasets. One dataset contained information of where the employee's of the company GASTech had been located the last two weeks, another HVAC information such as wind speed, humidity, temperature. 

Two sensors placed in two locations of the compound also recorded the hazium level, a fictional deadly gas. The task was to analyse the data and visualise what employee's were in danger, to anticipate change or any other interesting conclusion that could be extracted.
