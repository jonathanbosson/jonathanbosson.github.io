Well. I finally got to create my personal website. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. We'll see how well I end up using it. I'll be adding posts about past projects retroactively, so don't be too confused if you see the blogs months prior to the 'site launch'.
