Hey.

Since the last project I published here I've been working with smaller labs. I recently took a course in Parallel Programming, <em>TDDC78</em>, to get a foot into how to think efficiently and with regards to multiple threads. I mostly worked with the open API's [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/wp/) and [MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) with the National Supercomputer Centre ([NSC](https://www.nsc.liu.se/)) in Link√∂ping. With it I also learned more about the low tier architecture of different processors and the underlying reasons why techniques such as loop tiling are vital for efficiency.
I got the labs up at different branches on my [github](https://github.com/jonathanbosson/TDDC78).

Another course I recently finished was Modelling and Animation, <em>TNM079</em>. A technical course discussing lots of different aspects and techniques in computer graphics and modelling manipulations. Topics such as [half edge](/reports/lab1_jonbo665) data structure, [decimation](/reports/lab2_jonbo665), [splines and subdivision](/reports/lab3_jonbo665), [implicit surfaces](/reports/lab4_jonbo665), [levelsets](/reports/lab5_jonbo665) and [fluid simulations](/reports/lab6_jonbo665). 
For the labs I used a fairly well documented [code base](https://github.com/jonathanbosson/TNM079), which of where I managed to never push from my own log in.

Have a read at any of the six reports for a quick look at what it's about.

Next coming weeks I'm finishing a project with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with an MLP-neural network to solve equations using a webcam with the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) API. I'm also working with two developers on our own implementation of a graphic simulation of the [Divergence-Free SPH for Incompressible Fluids](https://animation.rwth-aachen.de/media/papers/2016-TVCG-ViscousDFSPH.pdf) publication done by Jan Bender and Dan Koschier, which should be finished in time for Christmas.
